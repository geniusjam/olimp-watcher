Discord webhook for announcements of TÜBİTAK Bilim Olimpiyatları announcements.
Pings TÜBİTAK's website every minute (configurable) and makes an announcement when something new is detected.
# Setup
1. Channel Settings > Integrations > Create Webhook > Copy URL
2. Paste the URL into .env
3. `npm i` upon first run
4. `node index.js` to run the app.
# Configuration
See example.env
PING_EVERY is in minutes.
You may leave CONTENT blank. The webhook will send the content along with the announcement's embed. If you want certain roles to be mentioned when a new announcement is made, it is a good idea to mention the roles in CONTENT.
